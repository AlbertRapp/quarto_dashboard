# Welcome

On this page, we made the chart more interactive.
We made this into an Observable Plot (which has similar syntax to `ggplot2`) using an OJS code chunk.
The cool thing about this is that we can use Oberservable's interactivity now and add a slider and tie it to the chart.
All of this can be done without having to host the Quarto dashboard on a Shiny server or something like this.
