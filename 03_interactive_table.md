# Welcome

On this page, we made the table interactive.
You can now click on the column headers to sort the table by that column.
This was made possible by the `{reactable}` package.
Also, the charts that are included are created via the `{ggiraph}` package as it allows to convert a static plot into a svg file that can be used in the `{reactable}` package.
