# Welcome

On this page, we made the table **even more interactive**.
You can now unfold a sidebar where checkboxes are waiting for you. 
With these checkboxes, you can toggle the species that you want to see inside of the table.
The table is mostly the same `{reactable}` table as before.
The only change is that behind the scenes, a couple of JS snippets were inserted to filter the table.
